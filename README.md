# MassWpScan
MassWpScan is just a basic script python to scan a list of WordPress Website. I'll improve this project when I have time for this. If you have any issues, open it.

# Requirements
First you need to download and install WpScan


## API KEY

You need to go on [WPSCAN](https://wpscan.com/), create a free account and go on your profile to have your API KEY. So copy it and save it in file or notepad whatever.

## Kali Linux : 

```shell
sudo apt install wpscan -y
```

## Other setup

You can found other setup like Docker directly on [WPSCAN github page](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan).


# Disclaimer 
- With a free account, you can do 25 scans per day.
- This project was created because I'm busy to do scan one by one for my presentations and other stuff.

- **Don't use it to hack WebSite**
